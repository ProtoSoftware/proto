## FaQ 

### Will there be a GUI for Proto?
Yes! A GUI is planned to be added to the project in due time, but development on this has not yet started as other things take higher priority (improved utility, decoupled methods)

### What makes this different from other tools?
A lot of other tools that offer this utility are no longer maintained actively, leaving them to stop working over time. Proto is planned to be recieve bug fixes and optimizations long after active feature development is finished.
