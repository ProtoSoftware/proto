## Preamble 
### What is this?
This file outlines the following standards that should be followed in order for your repository to have full support within Proto via the proton source option. 
You can also apply it when building your own tooling around custom proton downloads no matter the programming language or toolchain.

### Why does this exist?
Supporting multiple download repositories within Proto without these standards in place would mean having to make workarounds for each repository and 
how they release their custom proton versions. With this standard in place codebases doesn't become littered with per-repository fixes and allows users the freedom
of using the tool for whatever version of Proton they want to download.

### How do I implement these standards?
It should be pretty simple no matter how you release your code! The rules below govern how Proto will work with files, checksums and other data when fetching from your repository, 
all you need to do is implement them within your development lifecycle.

## Section 1: Packaging

## Section 2: Checksums

## Section 3: Tags & Release Names
